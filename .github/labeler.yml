####### LABELS based on FILE CHANGES #######

# Here, we declare Rules for Labeling PR based on the file changes

# Each Label is added, when their Rule(s) are True
# - 'any' block is True, if any of the conditions are True
# - 'all' block is True, if all of the conditions are True

# Typically a Label, only features one of 'any' or 'all' block

# Each label declares Rules that are mutually exclusive, in boolean logic.
# Thus, the set of matching file paths are non-overlapping, across the labels.
