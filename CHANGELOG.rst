Added the new `Pytest Plugin` Project Type, designed for developing Pytest
Plugins and Fixtures (see below).

- Module + CLI: a Python Package proving a Software Library and an
    "installable" (executable) Command Line Program/Interface (CLI)
- Pytest Plugin: a Python Package intended to providing a Pyetst Plugin (ie with
    a Test Fixture)

1.4.0 (2022-06-06)
==================

Add a CLI as an entrypoint to your Python Package
-------------------------------------------------

This release enables the user to optionally provide their Python Package with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) as an entrypoint.
The *add_cli* Generator Variable has been added to behave as an enable/disable
'switch'.

Changes
^^^^^^^

feature
"""""""
- add 'dev' & 'dev-cov' envs, designed to run locally with 'python3' from PATH
- allow user to scaffold a cli with an entrypoint when installing their package

fix
"""

1.3.0 (2022-05-31)
==================

Python Interpreters Support and Test
------------------------------------

This release allows the user to select the Python Interpreters they wish their Project
to support and be tested on.
The generator then creates the Test Matrix in the CI config file, which factors in the
Python Interpreter versions supplied by the user. 

Consistent with the currect behaviour of the cli, passing the '--no-input' flag,
instructs the Generator to try find the selected interpreters in a config yaml file,
if given, or else to use the information in the cookiecutter.json.

If the '--no-input' flag is missing, then the user is asked for input, through
their console.
The input is read by supplying an interactive console dialog, which allows the user to
easily select the interpreters they wish to support, by enabling or disabling
'check boxes' through their console.

Development
-----------

All tox environments related to 'Linting' now all do by default a 'check'.
Doing a 'check' means returning a 0 as exit code in case the check is successfull
and it is suitable for local and remote running on a CI server.

The aforementioned environments are 'lint', 'black', 'isort':
- tox -e lint
- tox -e black
- tox -e isort

Optionally, running as below will modify the source code to comply with
each respective 'lint check'.

Running environment 'lint', 'black', 'isort' with 'lint apply' enabled:
- *APPLY_LINT= tox -e lint*
- *APPLY_BLACK= tox -e black*
- *APPLY_ISORT= tox -e isort*

Changes
^^^^^^^

feature
"""""""
- generate the Project's CI Test Workflow with a build matrix based on the user's input python interpreters

test
""""

their corresponding CI services!

0.10.0 (2022-05-11)
===================

Enhance the Template's project generated CI config, by adding extra `checks` in Test Jobs and
automating the `integration` with the `codecov.io` hosting service.

Added `checks`
--------------

- Doing a 'Lint check' on the code
- Doing a 'Compliance check' of the resulting packaged distro against python best practices
- Gathering and sending the Test Suite results to the codecov.io service

Code Coverage
-------------

Include `step` in all Test Jobs to gather and send Code Coverage data resulting from running
the Test Suite.

    `Codecov` is to Code Coverage, as `GA` is to Continuous Integration.

    Upon granting permission, `codecov` will start accepting the accumulated results (such as
    Code Coverage data) from all `Test Jobs` during a `build` and provide a web UI featuring
    interactive visualization of the python code and its `coverage` on user-defined granularity
    level, interactive charts of the `coverage` evolution and more.

ci
--
Apply the same CI additions as the ones added for the Template project (see above)!
Namely:

- extra `checks` in the `Test Jobs`
- `integration` with the `codecov.io` Code Coverage hosting service

documentation
-------------
Add some "juicy" **code badges** in `README`, to demonstrate the `status` reported by
the various `CI services` that this repository integrates with. The badges are updated
automatically, as their respective status reporting (web) service `continuously integrates`
(ie triggers per commit) with the `cookiecutter-python-package` Project.
