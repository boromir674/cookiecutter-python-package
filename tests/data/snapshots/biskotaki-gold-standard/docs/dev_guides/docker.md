# Do Docker-related stuff


## How to prevent any Image from being published to Dockerhub

1. Open your `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, and look for the **Worfklow Variables**
    
    **Worfklow Variables** are defined in the `env` *section*

2. Check the *value* of the `DOCKER_JOB_ON` **Worfklow Variable**
    
    [this is line is not rendered; markdown comment]: #

    ![Docker OFF](../assets/docker_off.png)

3. If *value* is **false**, then we are OK.
    
4. If not, set value* to **false**

    ```shell
    git add .github/workflows/test.yaml
    git commit "ci: emphemerally prevent any Image Build and Dockerhub Publish"
    ```

Now, it is **guaranteed**, that **NO** Dockerhub Publish will happen,
by any Pipeline subsequent `trigger`, aka `git events` (ie `git push`) fired.

**Info**: the `DOCKER_JOB_ON` is a top-level Gate to all Docker-related in CI.
Only, if `DOCKER_JOB_ON` is **true**, any image build and publish can be ever considered.
