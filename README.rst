Features
========

- Python Package Project generation
- CI pipeline to test against multiple Python versions and Platforms
- One-line commands for DevOps activities such as 'package', 'build', 'deploy'
- Test Suite, using Pytest


Prerequisites
=============

You need to have Cookiecutter installed.
Check the `Cookiecutter documentation`_ pages for more on Cookiecutter.


Usage
=====

Simply, get (clone) the code and generate a Project based on the (downloaded) template.

Open a console/terminal and run:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone git@github.com:boromir674/cookiecutter-python-package.git

    cookiecutter cookiecutter-python-package/src/cookiecutter_python


This will generate a new `Python Package Project` (in the currect dir), using the template from github.
It shall prompt you to enter the necessary initial information to generate the project in a typical cookiecutter fashion.


Modifying the Template
======================

You can always adjust the template to your needs, before generating a new Project.

Open a console/terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:boromir674/cookiecutter-python-package.git
    cd cookiecutter-python-package


Now, you should be inside the `cookiecutter-python-package` repository (directory)
and the actual Template, that you can modify, is inside the `src/cookiecutter_python` sub directory.

After, finishing the modifications you can run something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter src/cookiecutter_python --output-dir <your-new-project-dir>
