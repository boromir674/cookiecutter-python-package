| Generate Python Project, with CI/CD Pipeline for PyPI and Docker builds for easy DevOps.
| **Documentation available at https://python-package-generator.readthedocs.io/.**

What's included?
================

* `Generator` **CLI** to scaffold a modern Python Project, with cross-platform support; **Linux**, **MacOS**, **Windows**
* Option for Python Package "variant", supporting `module`, `module+cli`, and `pytest-plugin`
* Template (source at `src/cookiecutter_python/`_) of over **24 files** (see `Quickstart`_), to generate Project featuring:
  
  * Fully featured **CI/CD Pipeline**, running on `Github Actions`_, defined in `.github/`
  * **Documentation Pages**, with `sphinx` or `mkdocs`, hosted on `readthedocs` server, located in `docs` dir
  * **Test Suite**, using `pytest`_, located in `tests` dir
  * **Pypi Deploy Command**, supporting upload to both `pypi.org`_ and `test.pypi.org`_ servers
  * **Type Check Command**, using `mypy`_
  * **Lint** *Check* and `Apply` commands, using the fast `Ruff`_ linter, along with standard `isort`_, and `black`_
  * **Build Command**, using the `build`_ python package


What to expect?
===============

You can to be up and running with a new Python Package, and run workflows on Github Actions, such as:

.. image is expected to mostly be rendered on github.com, pypi.org, readthedocs.io
   in any case we care for these pages. Adjust images props (ie width if needed)

1. **CI Pipeline**, running on `Github Actions`_, defined in `.github/`

   a. **Job Matrix**, spanning different `platform`'s and `python version`'s

      1. Platforms: `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`
      2. Python Interpreters: `3.6`, `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`
   b. **Parallel Job** execution, generated from the `matrix`, that runs the `Test Suite`
   c. **Artifact** store of **Source** and **Wheel** Distributions, factoring Platform and Python Version


Auto Generated Sample Package **Biskotaki**
-------------------------------------------

Check the **Biskotaki** *Python Package Project*, for a taste of the project structure and capabilities this Template can generate!

It it entirely generated using this **Python Package Template:**

| **Source Code** hosted on *Github* at https://github.com/boromir674/biskotaki
| **Python Package** hosted on *pypi.org* at https://pypi.org/project/biskotaki/
| **CI Pipeline** hosted on *Github Actions* at https://github.com/boromir674/biskotaki/actions


Quickstart
==========

To **install** the latest ``Generator`` in your environment, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install cookiecutter-python

The ``generate-python`` CLI should become available in your environment.

Next, create a file, let's call it ``gen-config.yml``, with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

    default_context:
        project_name: Demo Generated Project
        project_type: module+cli
        full_name: John Doe
        email: john.doe@something.org
        github_username: john-doe
        project_short_description: 'Demo Generated Project Description'
        initialize_git_repo: no
        interpreters: {"supported-interpreters": ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]}


To **generate** a Python Package Project, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    mkdir gen-demo-dir
    cd gen-demo-dir
    
    generate-python --config-file ../gen-config.yml --no-input


Now, you should have generated a new Project for a Python Package, based on the `Template`_!

The Project should be located in the newly created ``demo-generated-project`` directory.


To leverage all out-of-the-box development operations (ie scripts), install `tox`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m pip install --user 'tox<4'

To verify tox available in your environment, run: ``tox --version``


Please, do a `cd` into the newly created directory, ie `cd <my-great-python-package>`.

To run the Test Suite, `cd` into the newly created Project folder, and run:

.. code-block:: shell

    tox -e dev

All Tests should pass, and you should see a `coverage` report!


To run Type Checking against the Source Code, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    tox -e type

All Type Checks should pass!


To setup a Git Repository, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    git init
    git add .
    git checkout -b main
    git commit -m "Initial commit"


To setup a Remote Repository, run for example:

.. code-block:: shell

    git remote add origin <remote-repository-url>
    git push -u origin main


To trigger the CI/CD Pipeline, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    git push

Navigate to your github.com/username/your-repo/actions page, to see the CI Pipeline running!

| Develop your package's **Source Code** (`business logic`) inside `src/my_great_python_package` dir :)
| Develop your package's **Test Suite** (ie `unit-tests`, `integration tests`) inside `tests` dir :-)

Read the Documentation's `Use Cases`_ section for more on how to leverage your generated Python Package features.


Next Steps
----------

To prepare for an Open Source Project Development Lifecycle, you should visit the following websites:

* PyPI, test.pypi.org, Dockerhub, and Read the Docs, for setting up Release and Documentation Pipelines
* github.com/your-account to configure Actions, through the web UI
* Codecov, Codacy, and Codeclimate, for setting up Automated Code Quality, with CI Pipelines
* https://www.bestpractices.dev/ for registering your Project for OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

**Happy Developing!**
